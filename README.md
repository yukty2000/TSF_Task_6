# TSF_Task_6

Iris.csv - Provided Dataset

Yukty_Khandelia_Task_6.ipynb - It is my official submission for GRIP.
                         Task 6 : Create a Decision Tree Classifier and visualise it.
                         
DecisionTreeFromScratch.ipynb - As suggested on my linkedin post, I created this decision tree
                         for learning purposes , to see what lies beyond the blackbox of the DecsionTreeClassifier() in the sklearn package.
                         I however , was unable to provide a visualisation for the tree thus, created. Therefore, this could not become my official submission.
                         All suggestions and feedback are welcome.
